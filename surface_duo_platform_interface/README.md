# surface_duo_platform_interface

Platform interface specification for the Surface Duo SDK. It is likely that this project will only 
ever support Android (the OS that Surface Duo runs), but it may be relevant to add support for
windows devices eventually.

# Usage

Don't use this package directly -- use a platform interface package specifically for your platform, 
or use the official package which endorses the Android one in this repo.
